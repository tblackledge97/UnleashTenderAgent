    "description": "The Natural Hazards Technology Program (the ‘Program’) is a new $1.89 million competitive grants program in 2023/24 to accelerate technology innovation and adoption to better prepare for and respond to natural hazards by trialling field-ready technology with end-user NSW agencies. It builds on the success of the Bushfire Technology Pilots Program and expands the remit to provide tangible assistance in overcoming challenges from natural hazards, specifically floods and bushfires. There is also a big ideas stream where companies can propose innovative technologies for trialling to help identify future technology capabilities. The Program provides up to $250,000 in funding for companies to field test their technology solutions over a 12-month period with partnering NSW agencies. It aims to provide tangible assistance in overcoming challenges faced during all phases of natural hazards management, including Planning, Prevention, Preparedness, Response, and Recovery.",
